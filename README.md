# Digital-Library
C++ basic exam

-The whole layout of the project is in the file "Application operation diagram". Only 'ru' language.
The digital library has the ability to keep records of books and readers. Issue and return books. Track book popularity and reader activity. 
Edit all information and sort lists. Also, the program saves the list of books and readers to a file after completion and uploads to the program when it starts.

-It took 2 weeks to develop. There are many features and things that can still be optimized and redone, but there is no particular need for this. 
The meaning of the project was to fix and summarize the knowledge gained over half a year self-study in the C ++ language.
